# When building with customized GN arguments, it may happen ANGLE and
# Dawn settings can result in conflicting values for Vulkan. Values
# derived from ANGLE will take precedence here, as currently the Vulkan
# repositories are always fetched via ANGLE's DEPS file. One should
# override the defaults at his/her own risk, or just consider disabling
# the other backend when conflicts happen.
